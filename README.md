# Python Scripts

Welcome to the **Python Scripts** repository! This collection contains various Python-based command-line interface (CLI) tools and utilities, created as part of my learning journey in Python programming. The repository will continue to grow as I explore new concepts and add more scripts.

## üöÄ Features

### 1. **CLI Calculator**
   A simple command-line calculator that supports basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### 2. **Password Validator**
   This script checks the validity of a password based on customizable rules such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

### 3. **CLI ATM Simulator**
   Simulate basic ATM functionalities, such as checking balance, withdrawing, and depositing money, all through the command line.

### 4. **Basic Shopping CLI Simulator**
   A command-line shopping simulator where users can add items to a cart, view the total, and check out, providing a simple yet functional shopping experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

Clone the repository and navigate to the script you want to run. Make sure you have Python installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Priyanshu-Priya/Python-Scripts.git
cd Python-Scripts
```

Run any script with:

```bash
python script_name.py
```

## üìö Future Additions
This repository will be continuously updated with new scripts as I dive deeper into Python programming. Stay tuned for more CLI-based tools and utilities!
